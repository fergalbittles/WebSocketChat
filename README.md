# WebSocketChat

This is a basic chatroom application which I built during my internship to improve my understanding of real-time updates using Socket.IO.

To get started, follow these steps:

- Run `npm install && npx nodemon index.js`
- Browse to `http://localhost:9080` within multiple tabs
- Send a message and see it render in all tabs

# What I Learned

- Developed a better understanding of real-time updates using WebSocket technology.
